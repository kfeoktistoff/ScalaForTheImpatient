In the Creature class of Section10, replace val range with a def. What happens when
you also use a def in the Ant subclass? What happens when you use a val in the subclass? Why?

'def range()' in Creature and 'def range()' in Ant: env.size = 2
'val range' in Creature and 'def range()' in Ant: error (def cannot override val)
'def range' in Creature and 'val range()' in Ant: env.size = 0
'val range' in Creature and 'val range()' in Ant: env.size = 0
