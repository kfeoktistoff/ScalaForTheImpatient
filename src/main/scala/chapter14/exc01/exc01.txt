Your Java Development Kit distribution has the source code for much of the JDK in the src.zip file.
Unzip and search for case labels (regular expression case [^:]+:). Then look for comments starting with //
and containing [Ff]alls? thr to catch comments such as // Falls through or // just fall thru.
Assuming the JDK programmers follow the Java code convention, which requires such a comment, what percentage of cases falls through?


Approximately 11000 places where 'case' construction is used and less than 300 where falling through is useful feature. (JDK 1.7)
