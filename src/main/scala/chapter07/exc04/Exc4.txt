Why do you think the Scala language designers provided the package object
syntax instead of simply letting you add functions and variables to a package?

Package objects contain some common data - constants and functions which
cannot be assigned to a particular class. A package object has unified name 'package.scala',
so it can be easily found by a programmer who wants to add a new data there.
