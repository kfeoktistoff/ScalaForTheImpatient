What is the meaning of private[com] def giveRaise(rate: Double)? Is it useful?

This method declaration means that the method is available from the class contains
the method or from package which contains the class of parent packages of the class's
package up to the [com] package.
It makes sense if 'com' package was redefined (bad style) or to hide the method from
packages like 'org', 'java' etc.
